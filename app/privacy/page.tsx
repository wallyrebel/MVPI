        <p>
          This policy explains what information is collected when you visit the Mississippi Volleyball Power Index
          (&ldquo;MVPI&rdquo;, &ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;this site&rdquo;) at mississippivolleyballrankings.com, and how that information is used. MVPI is an
          independent publication and is not affiliated with the MHSAA, MAIS, TSSAA, or any school or school district.
        </p>

        <h2>Information we collect</h2>
        <p>
          This site does not ask you to create an account, and it has no contact form, newsletter signup, comment
          system, or payment processing. We do not knowingly collect names, email addresses, postal addresses or
          payment details from visitors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like most websites, our hosting provider and analytics and advertising partners automatically receive
          standard technical information when you load a page. That can include your IP address, browser type and
          version, device type, operating system, the page you requested, the referring page, and the date and time of
          the request.
        </p>

        <h2>Cookies and similar technologies</h2>
        <p>
          Cookies are small files stored on your device. This site uses them for analytics and, where ads are shown,
          for advertising. You can block or delete cookies in your browser settings; the rankings remain fully readable
          with cookies disabled.
        </p>

        <h2>Analytics</h2>
        <p>
          We use Google Analytics 4 to understand which pages are read and how visitors arrive. Google Analytics sets
          cookies and processes technical data such as IP address, pages viewed, approximate location derived from IP,
          and session duration. We use this only in aggregate, to decide what to publish. We do not attempt to identify
          individual visitors.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can opt out of Google Analytics across all sites by installing Google&rsquo;s{' '}
          <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
            browser opt-out add-on
          </a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Advertising</h2>
        <p>
          This site may display advertising supplied by Google, including Google AdSense, and by other third-party ad
          vendors and networks. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on your prior
          visits to this and other websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google&rsquo;s use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to you based on your visit to
          this site and other sites on the internet. You can opt out of personalized advertising by visiting{' '}
          <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Ads Settings</a>.
          You can also opt out of a third-party vendor&rsquo;s use of cookies for personalized advertising at{' '}
          <a href="https://optout.aboutads.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aboutads.info</a> or{' '}
          <a href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">

          </a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third-party ad networks may use cookies, web beacons or similar technologies that we do not control. Their use
          of that information is governed by their own privacy policies, not this one.
        </p>

        <h2>Visitors in the EEA, UK and Switzerland</h2>
        <p>
          Where required, advertising and analytics cookies that are not strictly necessary are set only with consent,
          collected through a consent notice before those cookies load. You may withdraw consent at any time by
          clearing cookies for this site in your browser. Our lawful basis for processing is your consent for analytics
          and advertising cookies, and legitimate interest in the secure operation of the site for basic server logs.

        </ul>

        <h2>Children</h2>
        <p>
          This site publishes statistics about high school athletic teams, not about individual minors, and it is not
          directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you
          believe a child has provided personal information, contact us and we will delete it.
        </p>

        <h2>Data retention and security</h2>
        <p>
          We do not operate a visitor database. Analytics data is retained by Google under the retention period set for
          our property, after which it is deleted by Google. The site is served over HTTPS.
        </p>

        <h2>External links</h2>
        <p>
          Pages may link to outside sources, including media and athletic association sites. We are not responsible for
          the content or privacy practices of those sites.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this policy as the site changes. The &ldquo;last updated&rdquo; date above always reflects the current
          version.
        </p>
